## My learning Experience
I'm not going to lie,this has been the **toughest project** I’ve done so far, but also the one I’ve learned the most from.
- I gained a deeper understanding of **how JavaScript flows work** in an app.
- Learned understood and reminded myself about event listeners, dataset attributes, dynamic element creation and updating the DOM.
- Practiced breaking down problems into smaller functions.

Even though it was challenging, completing this project really improved my confidence understanding JavaScript logic.

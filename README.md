# Quiz-App
This is a simple quiz application I am building using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app presents the user with 4 multiple-choice questions. Each question has 4 possible answers, and only one of them is correct. The user selects an answer for each question, and after completing all 4, the app calculates and displays the final score.
